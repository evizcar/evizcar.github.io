          <p>Howdy! Hola! My name is Elsa Vizcarra and I currently live in Austin, Texas.</p>

          <h2 id="about">About</h2>
          <p>I am currently a student at <a href="https://sph.uth.edu/campuses/austin"> UTSPH</a> at the Austin campus studying for an MPH in Epidemiology with a focus on biostatistics and policy. 
            I have worked in the public health field for a number of years, gathering experience, and applied and practical skills that have been invaluable in driving my passion for health equity. My career and research interests include 
            maternal and child health, health equity, and data analysis.</p>

          <p>You can browse my <a href="">CV</a> for more info. Below is list of projects I have been part of and that I am working on. For more information, visit the lins to read the related papers.</p>

          <h3>Automating the Browser for End-Users</h3>
          <div>We built a tool to allow end-users to automate the browser, a simple form of macros for websites. End-users demonstrate the task they want performed and our tool, Ringer, synthesizes a program that can complete that task. My PhD <a href="https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2015/EECS-2015-266.html">thesis</a> is on this work. My co-author <a href="https://schasins.com/">Sarah Chasins</a> built a set of tools using this framework, including the <a href="https://helena-lang.org/">Helena</a> language.</div>
